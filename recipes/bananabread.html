    <h2>Bread Baker’s Date and Banana Tea Cake</h2>
    <p>With whole grain spelt and sourdough starter discard.</p>

    <p>This date and banana tea cake was ideal because it takes just two bowls, can be done by hand, and can be paused at any moment (things could always come up in the busy Tartine kitchen). One person would measure out all the wet ingredients and another person would measure out all the dry ingredients. We’d stir it all up with a spatula in the biggest mixing bowl we had, divide the batter among pans, and pop the pans into the oven during any brief window of available oven space.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1143gr - White flour (about 11.5% of protein) - 100.00%</li>
        <li>743gr - Water 1 (Levain and autolyse) - 65.00%</li>
        <li>57gr - Water 2 (Mix) - 5.00%</li>
        <li>21gr - Salt - 1.80%</li>
        <li>37gr - Ripe sourdough starter, 100% hydration - 3.30%</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the levain - 9.00am</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>74gr - White flour (about 11.5% of protein) - 100.00%</li>
            <li>74gr - Water 1 - 100.00%</li>
            <li>37gr - Ripe sourdough starter, 100% hydration - 50.00%</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Use your sourdough starter when ripe, mix the above ingredients in a jar, and leave them covered at a warm temperature, 74-76°F (23-24°C), to ripen for 5 hours.</p>
        
        <li><strong>Autolyse - 1.00pm</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>1068gr - White flour (about 11.5% of protein)</li>
            <li>668gr - Water 1</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Warm or cool the autolyse water so that the temperature of the mixed dough meets the FDT (final dough temperature) of 78°F (25°C) for this recipe. Place the flour and water 1 in a large bowl. Use wet hands to mix until no dry bits remain; the dough will be shaggy and loose. Use a bowl scraper to scrape down the sides of the bowl to keep all the dough in one area at the bottom. Cover the bowl and place it near your levain for 1 hour.</p>
