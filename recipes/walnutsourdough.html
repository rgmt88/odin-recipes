    <h2>Freshly Baked Walnut Cranberry Sourdough</h2>
    <p>Earthy walnuts and tart cranberries come together for one of my favorite bread recipes.</p>

    <p>Out of the oven, this loaf carries some of the most dramatic coloring of any bread I bake. The crust ranges from burnished to just a kiss of brown, stopping everywhere between. The stray cranberries and walnuts that might have made their way to the surface color deeply in the oven add even more of a dramatic landscape to this darkly expressed loaf. What an eater experiences in drama on the outside, is equally apparent inside, as each slice contains a scattering of sliced tart and sweet fruit and earthy nuts. But, the show's real star is the overall melding of flavors: the fruit, the nuts, and how the rich walnut oil enrobes the entire eating experience.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1143gr - White flour (about 11.5% of protein) - 100.00%</li>
        <li>743gr - Water 1 (Levain and autolyse) - 65.00%</li>
        <li>57gr - Water 2 (Mix) - 5.00%</li>
        <li>21gr - Salt - 1.80%</li>
        <li>37gr - Ripe sourdough starter, 100% hydration - 3.30%</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the levain - 9.00am</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>74gr - White flour (about 11.5% of protein) - 100.00%</li>
            <li>74gr - Water 1 - 100.00%</li>
            <li>37gr - Ripe sourdough starter, 100% hydration - 50.00%</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Use your sourdough starter when ripe, mix the above ingredients in a jar, and leave them covered at a warm temperature, 74-76°F (23-24°C), to ripen for 5 hours.</p>
        
        <li><strong>Autolyse - 1.00pm</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>1068gr - White flour (about 11.5% of protein)</li>
            <li>668gr - Water 1</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Warm or cool the autolyse water so that the temperature of the mixed dough meets the FDT (final dough temperature) of 78°F (25°C) for this recipe. Place the flour and water 1 in a large bowl. Use wet hands to mix until no dry bits remain; the dough will be shaggy and loose. Use a bowl scraper to scrape down the sides of the bowl to keep all the dough in one area at the bottom. Cover the bowl and place it near your levain for 1 hour.</p>
