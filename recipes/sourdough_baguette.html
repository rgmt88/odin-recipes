    <h2>Freshly Baked Baguette</h2>
    <p>A baguette is a long, thin type of bread of French origin that is commonly made from basic lean dough (the dough, though not the shape, is defined by French law). It is distinguishable by its length and crisp crust.</p>

    <p>A baguette has a diameter of about 5 to 6 centimeters and a usual length of about 65 cm, although a baguette can be up to 1 m long.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1143gr - White flour (about 11.5% of protein) - 100.00%</li>
        <li>743gr - Water 1 (Levain and autolyse) - 65.00%</li>
        <li>57gr - Water 2 (Mix) - 5.00%</li>
        <li>21gr - Salt - 1.80%</li>
        <li>37gr - Ripe sourdough starter, 100% hydration - 3.30%</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the levain - 9.00am</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>74gr - White flour (about 11.5% of protein) - 100.00%</li>
            <li>74gr - Water 1 - 100.00%</li>
            <li>37gr - Ripe sourdough starter, 100% hydration - 50.00%</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Use your sourdough starter when ripe, mix the above ingredients in a jar, and leave them covered at a warm temperature, 74-76째F (23-24째C), to ripen for 5 hours.</p>
        
        <li><strong>Autolyse - 1.00pm</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>1068gr - White flour (about 11.5% of protein)</li>
            <li>668gr - Water 1</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Warm or cool the autolyse water so that the temperature of the mixed dough meets the FDT (final dough temperature) of 78째F (25째C) for this recipe. Place the flour and water 1 in a large bowl. Use wet hands to mix until no dry bits remain; the dough will be shaggy and loose. Use a bowl scraper to scrape down the sides of the bowl to keep all the dough in one area at the bottom. Cover the bowl and place it near your levain for 1 hour.</p>
    </ol>
